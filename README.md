# roomulon_01
Text-based adventure roguelike.

A basic engine with a procedurally generated map.
Baddies that are randomly generated and wander the map.  
The map works based on the screen size and only works at one size right now which is a problem that has to be fixed.
There is also a knife that you can pick up in the first room and medpacks that are randomly generated throughout the map.
I also think the Player Object and the Room object can be put into their own files and node used to serve them to the app when needed.
